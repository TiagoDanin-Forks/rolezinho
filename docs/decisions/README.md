# Architecture decisions (`docs/decisions/`)

A record of the project's significant technical decisions, in ADR (Architecture Decision
Record) style. Each file describes **one decision**: the context that motivated it, the
options evaluated, the choice made, and the consequences.

Unlike `docs/flow/` (which describes the current behavior of a product flow), this folder
holds the **why** behind engineering choices — the thing that normally gets lost in git and
turns into "why was it done this way?" months later.

## Principles

- One file per decision. kebab-case name with a sequential numeric prefix:
  `NNNN-short-title.md` (e.g. `0001-event-password-stored-in-plaintext.md`).
- English, no emojis, objective.
- A decision describes the current state and the reasoning. If a decision is revisited
  later, write a new ADR that supersedes it and references the previous one — don't rewrite
  history.
- `updated_at: DD/MM/YYYY` frontmatter.
- ADR candidate: any choice a future reader might mistake for a bug, or would undo without
  knowing the cost.
