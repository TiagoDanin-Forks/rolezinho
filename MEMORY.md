# MEMORY.md

Working memory across sessions. The cycle:

1. **Note here** what you discover during a session: new patterns, non-obvious
   solutions, project conventions, gotchas.
2. **Promote to a rule** once a note proves stable and repeatable across several
   sessions — move the content to the right file under `.claude/rules/` (or to a doc
   in `docs/`) and delete the entry here.
3. **Fix or remove** entries that turn out to be wrong or outdated — stale memory is
   worse than no memory.

Entry format: one objective bullet, with a date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and enough context to
be useful without rereading the session.

## Discoveries

- 2026-07-26: **`storybook/ui/` does not duplicate `components/ui/`.** A `.story.exs`
  holds no component markup: it points at the function (`def function, do: &Mod.fun/1`)
  and lists which prop combinations to display. The variants themselves live in the
  component, declared and validated by `attr ... values: ~w(...)`. Deleting
  `storybook/` would cost the dev-only catalog at `/storybook` and nothing else. The
  two directories are separate because `content_path` (`storybook.ex:10`) must point
  outside `lib/` — `.story.exs` files are evaluated at runtime, not compiled as
  application code. A story's `template` block is the frame *around* the demo (the
  `bg-surface` box), not the component.
- 2026-07-26: **A story's slot must use the real component, not hand-written markup.**
  Slots are HTML strings evaluated at runtime, so `<.action_button>` is not in scope
  by default — the fix is `def imports, do: [{Mod, fun: 1}]`, not rebuilding the
  button out of loose classes. `bottom_sheet.story.exs` had done the latter and had
  already drifted (`rounded-card` where the CTA recipe is `rounded-cta`, plus a
  `px-3 text-xs` that matches no variant). When a story needs a styled element that
  no component covers, that is the signal the variant is missing from the component:
  the destructive confirmation became `variant="danger"` on `action_button` rather
  than a `!bg-danger` override at the call site.
- 2026-07-26: **The token vocabulary is the design handoff's, not daisyUI's.**
  `ink`/`canvas`/`surface`/`tint`/`accent`/`accent-ink`, radii `row`/`cta`/`card`/
  `sheet`, shadows `card`/`cta`/`sheet` — copied from the kit so handoff markup pastes
  in untranslated. Two traps: `accent` is the **orange**, not the dark tone (the
  earlier `@theme` had them inverted, which is why the orange was missing from the
  whole UI); and `ink` is "maximum contrast against the page", so it is near-white in
  dark. The legacy names (`primary`, `base-200`, `rounded-field`, ...) survive only as
  aliases in `@theme` so the pre-design-system screens keep working — do not use them
  in new markup.
- 2026-07-26: **A Storybook story maps to exactly one component function.**
  `%Variation{}` has only `id`, `description`, `note`, `let`, `slots`, `attributes`,
  and `template` — there is no per-variation `function` key. Passing one raises
  `KeyError` while compiling the story, and Storybook **still serves the page with
  HTTP 200**, showing an error panel instead of the component. So an HTTP check is
  not proof a story works: grep the server log for `Could not compile` too. A module
  exporting two components (`avatar`/`avatar_stack`, `card`/`well`) needs one story
  file each.
- 2026-07-26: **`mix format --check-formatted` only covers the `inputs` in
  `.formatter.exs`.** `storybook/` was outside it, so unformatted stories passed
  silently. The glob now includes `storybook/**/*.exs`. When adding a new top-level
  directory of Elixir files, add it to `inputs` in the same commit, or the formatter
  gate is a no-op for it.
- 2026-07-26: **`base-100` is not always the lightest token.** It is the *card
  surface* and `base-300` is the *page canvas*: in the light theme the card is
  lighter than the canvas, and in the dark theme it is darker. Use the roles, never
  assume a lightness direction — a component that hardcodes "base-100 = lighter"
  inverts in dark.

- 2026-07-26: **`escape: true` in Earmark is a security invariant, not a
  preference.** An event's description/header/footer is user markdown rendered with
  `raw(...)` in five places in `EventLive`. What prevents stored XSS is the
  `escape: true` option on the project's single `Earmark.as_html/2` call. Do not
  create a second markdown rendering path. Already promoted to `SECURITY.md`
  (section 1) in this session; it stays here as a reminder that this is the most
  fragile point in the code.
- 2026-07-26: **There is no `current_scope` in this project.** The app is public and
  account-less: the access levels are anonymous visitor, session with an unlocked
  event, and admin via an environment password. Writing a per-user ownership check
  here is a modeling error. Phoenix/LiveView rules from the wider ecosystem almost
  always assume `phx.gen.auth` — be suspicious when following them here.
- 2026-07-26: **Protecting an admin LiveView requires the plug *and* the
  `on_mount`.** The plug covers the HTTP request; the `on_mount` covers the socket
  connection, which does not pass through the pipeline. Either one alone leaves the
  surface open from the other side.
- 2026-07-26: **An event password is plaintext in the database by product
  decision**, not by oversight: the admin must be able to read it back to re-share
  it, and the share text can embed it. Do not "fix" it with hashing without treating
  that as a product change.
- 2026-08-16: **Group password gating has two symmetric evaluations, and both
  must be kept in sync.** For any surface that renders an event
  (`EventLive`, `RawController`, `CalendarController`), the unlock decision is:
  admin → open; group unlocked → open (bypasses the event's own password too);
  group locked → closed (even if the event has no password of its own); then
  fall back to the event's own password. `EventLive.mount/3` additionally
  redirects a locked-group visitor to `/g/:slug` so the password is entered in
  one place. Adding a fourth surface means copying the same five clauses —
  centralising them in a helper is fine, but the invariant is that the
  evaluation exists on every surface, not that it exists in one module.
- 2026-08-16: **`group_id` on `Event` is not cast.** Same reasoning as
  `organizer_token` — accepting it from params would let anyone drop an event
  into any group by id. Set it explicitly via `Event.put_group_id/2` (used by
  `Events.set_group/2`) or via `put_change` inside `Events.create/2` after the
  caller has been authorized against the group's password gate (which the
  create controller does).
- 2026-08-17: **Accounts are only for creation, and `current_user` is the
  only account-related assign.** Under ADR-0002, `POST /criar` and
  `POST /g/criar` are the two surfaces gated by a GitHub login; the rest of
  the app stays anonymous. Do not introduce `:current_scope`. When a
  logged-in user creates something, their id lands in
  `created_by_user_id` and grants durable organizer/edit rights over that
  one entity — via `Event.Policy.role/2`'s new clause and
  `Group.editable_by?/4`'s new arg. Grandfathered rows (`nil`) fall back to
  token/password/admin gates.
- 2026-08-17: **`created_by_user_id` is never cast from params, on either
  schema.** Same mass-assignment reasoning as `organizer_token` and
  `group_id`. Set it via `Event.put_created_by_user_id/2` /
  `Group.put_created_by_user_id/2`, or via `Ecto.Changeset.put_change/3`
  inside the contexts. The controllers read it from the server-held
  session, never from the form body.
- 2026-08-17: **Direct controller-action calls in tests skip the browser
  pipeline**, which means `fetch_flash/2` was never called. When testing
  `AuthController.callback/2` (or any other controller action) by calling
  the function directly, add `Phoenix.Controller.fetch_flash([])` to the
  conn first, or the first `put_flash` call raises `ArgumentError`.
- 2026-08-17: **`~p"/entrar?"` strips the trailing question mark.** Verified
  routes normalize an empty query string away, so
  `~p"/entrar?" <> URI.encode_query(...)` yields `/entrarreturn_to=...`
  (missing `?`). Use a plain string — `"/entrar?" <> URI.encode_query(...)`
  — or the query-interpolation form `~p"/entrar?#{[return_to: value]}"`.
- 2026-08-17: **The `:admin` live_session needs the User `on_mount` too.**
  Any LiveView that renders `<Layouts.app ... current_user={@current_user}>`
  must have that assign, and only the two on_mount hooks in the
  live_session put it there. `router.ex` now chains
  `[{Admin, :require_admin}, {User, :fetch}]` on `:admin` for that reason.
  Adding a third live_session in the future needs the same treatment.
