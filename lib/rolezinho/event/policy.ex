  Who may do what to an event and its rows.

  This is the permission matrix from the product spec, in one place, so a screen
  never decides for itself. Hiding a button is presentation; these functions are
  the decision, and a privileged `handle_event` has to call one of them even
  when the template already hid the control — a socket message can be sent
  without the button existing.

  The roles are ordered: `:admin` (environment-wide support bypass) can do
  whatever `:organizer` can, which can do whatever a `:participant` can on their
  own row. A `:visitor` may only read and join.

  | Action              | Visitor | Participant | Organizer |
  |---------------------|---------|-------------|-----------|
  | join a list         | yes     | yes         | yes       |
  | mark own payment    | no      | own row     | any row   |
  | mark another's      | no      | no          | yes       |
  | leave the list      | no      | own row     | any row   |
  | remove someone      | no      | no          | yes       |
  | promote from wait   | no      | no          | yes       |
  | edit details        | no      | no          | yes       |
  | close the event     | no      | no          | yes       |

  Resolves the caller's role for this event.

  Three ways to earn the organizer role (ADR-0002):

    * hold the environment-wide admin secret (`:admin?`),
    * hold the event's `organizer_token` in the session (`:organizer?`),
    * or be signed in as the user who created the event
      (`current_user_id == event.created_by_user_id`).

  A participant is anyone who owns a row on this event, by either identity
  (the per-device `participant_id` token, or the signed-in `user_id`). A
  visitor is everybody else.

  Returns true when the caller may flip the paid check on `attendee`.

  RN-12: a participant only ever marks their own row — the check is a statement
  about money they say they sent, so nobody else gets to make it for them.
  RN-13: the organizer may mark anyone, being the one who sees the money arrive.

  Same permission set as `can_remove?/3`: admin and organizer can edit any
  row; a participant can edit their own row (by either identity). Fixing a
  typo in your own name or answer is not a decision anyone else should have
  to gate.

  Kept as a dedicated function rather than reusing `can_remove?` so call
  sites read as what they do — the two decisions may diverge later (a
  frozen event that no longer accepts removals could still allow edits, or
  vice-versa) and there is no risk of one bug becoming two.
