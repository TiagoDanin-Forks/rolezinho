defmodule RolezinhoWeb.EventCreateController do
  @moduledoc """
  Creates an event and hands the organizer their secret.

  A controller rather than a LiveView event for the same structural reason
  joining is one: the organizer token has to land in the session to survive the
  next page load, and a LiveView cannot write there. Creating through a real
  request is what makes "whoever creates is the organizer" (RN-20) true for
  someone who is not the environment-wide admin.

  Without this, opening creation to everyone would hand people an event they
  could not administer — the token would exist in the database and nowhere else.

  When a `group` slug arrives with the request, the event is created inside
  that group only if the caller has enough access to edit the group (admin, or
  the group is password-protected and unlocked in this session). Otherwise the
  event still gets created — but ungrouped, with a flash explaining why. This
  is deliberate: silently attaching to a group anyone can name would let a
  visitor drop noise into someone else's bundle.
